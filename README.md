## What is this? ##

Use this script on your site to protest censorship of the Internet.  

After the page is loaded the script randomly censors text on the page by replacing the text with black bars.  It also places
a black bar at the top of the page with a link to http://americancensorship.org/.  Viewers can remove censoring for the 
current session by clicking on the "Remove this" link.
